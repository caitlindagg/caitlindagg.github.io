Hi! I'm Caitlin Dagg, a PhD candidate in Ecosystem Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation at the [Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie).

My research currently focuses on using remote sensing technologies like LiDAR to analyse vegetation structure and biodiversity on the Cumberland Plain in New South Wales, Australia. My goal is developing efficient and cost-effective methods for assessing biodiversity, prioritising sites, planning management interventions and monitoring at a landscape-scale.

## üîç **Research Highlights**
- **Remote Sensing (LiDAR):** Using spatial data to quantify vegetation structure.
- **Vegetation Structure & Biodiversity:** Understanding the relationships between vegetation complexity and species diversity.
- **Conservation Prioritisation:** Developing landscape-scale strategies for effective restoration and conservation.
- **Management Interventions:** Building on knowledge of specific structure-biodiversity relationships to plan concrete and effective management actions.

Explore more in my [Research](research) section.

## üì∞ **Recent News**
- **Upcoming Conference Presentation:**  
  I‚Äôll be presenting my research on the my work looking at the relationship between Vegetation Structure and Biodiversity in the Cumberland Plain at SER in Denver on October 3rd. Stay tuned for updates!

- **Birdlife Australia Community Grant**
  I've received a grant to conduct a research project using passive acoustic records to monitor Powerful Owl breeding success at known nesting sites in the Sydney region, and explore the possibility of vocal fingerprinting individuals.
