## My Research

I am currently a PhD candidate focusing on **ecosystem restoration**, **biodiversity conservation**, and **landscape-scale ecological analysis**. My work primarily involves using **remote sensing** techniques (including LiDAR) to understand and improve the resilience of ecosystems, particularly in the **Cumberland Plain**. I'm part of the [**Cumberland Plain Conservation Plan** research group](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/research/cumberland_plain_research).

### Current Research Projects:
- **Vegetation Structure and Biodiversity on the Cumberland Plain**: Understanding the relationship between vegetation structure and biodiversity across different landscapes to inform restoration and conservation efforts.
- **Remote Sensing for Ecosystem Monitoring**: Using LiDAR and other remote sensing technologies to analyze vegetation structure and assess the health and resilience of ecosystems.
- **Conservation Prioritisation and Restoration**: Developing strategies for prioritizing conservation efforts and restoring degraded ecosystems using data-driven approaches.

### Future Directions:
I am also interested in exploring:
- Landscape-scale conservation planning
- Connectivity between fragmented habitats
- Agroecology and conservation in working landscapes


### Looking Ahead:
I’ll be starting my search for a **postdoctoral position** in mid-2025. My areas of interest include:
- **Landscape-Scale Conservation**
- **Connectivity and Biodiversity**
- **Conservation in Working Landscapes & Agroecology**
- **Avian Conservation**
