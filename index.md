# Welcome to My Academic Website

Hi! I'm Caitlin Dagg, a PhD candidate in **Ecosystem Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation** at the [Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie).

My research currently focuses on using **remote sensing technologies** like LiDAR to analyse vegetation structure and biodiversity on the **Cumberland Plain** in New South Wales, Australia. I aim to develop data-driven conservation and restoration strategies to improve ecosystem resilience and health.

## üîç **Research Highlights**
- **Vegetation Structure & Biodiversity:** Understanding the relationships between vegetation complexity and species diversity.
- **Remote Sensing (LiDAR):** Using advanced spatial data to monitor ecosystems and detect changes over time.
- **Conservation Prioritization:** Developing landscape-scale strategies for effective restoration and conservation.

Explore more in my [Research](research) section.
